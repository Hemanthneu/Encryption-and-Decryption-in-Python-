Implementing the Columnar Transposition Cipher

Welcome to the Encryption and Decryption in Python project! This repository focuses on the implementation of a TranspositionCipher class, a fundamental tool for encrypting and decrypting text using the columnar transposition cipher method. This project is a significant step towards contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance data security and confidentiality in programming.

Project Objectives:

Develop a Python class, TranspositionCipher, that enables encryption and decryption of messages using the columnar transposition cipher.
Create a constructor function allowing the cipher's key to be specified during initialization.
Implement methods for encrypting and decrypting messages, ensuring secure communication.
Key Components of TranspositionCipher Class:

Constructor Function:
Accepts the cipher's key as an argument during initialization.

Encryption Method:
Encrypts a plaintext message using the specified key.

Decryption Method:
Decrypts a ciphertext message using the provided key.

Optional Challenge:

As an additional challenge (though not mandatory for project completion), consider implementing a function outside the TranspositionCipher class. This function should be capable of hacking the columnar transposition cipher, enabling decryption of a ciphertext without prior knowledge of the key. The function should return both the decrypted message and the key used.

Explore this repository to access the Python code, resources, and tools necessary for implementing and utilizing the TranspositionCipher class. Gain a deeper understanding of encryption techniques and contribute to the ongoing advancement of data security practices in programming.
